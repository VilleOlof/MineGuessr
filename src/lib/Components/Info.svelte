<h2 class="my-1 text-2xl font-bold">How does it work?</h2>
<p class="md:text-xl">
	One game has 5 rounds in it. <br />
	For each round, you'll get a randomized location from the world. <br />
	Your task is to guess where you are in the world, using the map. <br />
	<br />
	You earn points based on how close you guessed. <br />
</p>

<h2 class="my-1 mt-4 text-2xl font-bold">Points system</h2>
<p class="md:text-xl">
	If you're within 16 blocks of the location, you'll get 5000 points. <br />
	For each block away from the location, you lose 0.25 points. <br />
	The timer doesn't effect your points at all. <br />
</p>

<h2 class="my-1 mt-4 text-2xl font-bold">Daily mode</h2>
<p class="md:text-xl">
	Each day, the places gets swapped out. <br />
	You can only play the daily mode once a day. <br />
	<br />
	This makes it easy to challenge your friends!
</p>

<h2 class="my-1 mt-4 text-2xl font-bold">Leaderboard</h2>
<p class="md:text-xl">
	See who guesses the best! <br />
	Log in to get a spot on the leaderboard. <br />
	<br />
	First sorts after points, and then time. <br />
	Leaderboard doesn't include daily mode games.
